Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of Machine Learning in which an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
Reinforcement Learning (RL) because it is not depends on data he rely on the experience he gains from the environment like the humans beings.
Neural Networks are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
(CNNs) are a specialized type of feedforward neural network that are designed to process grid-like data, such as images.
